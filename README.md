# Stephen D'Arcy - The Cupcake Factory
​
## The Cupcake Factory
​

A comprehensive website for a traditional portrait artist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 
Website features a promotional video, testimonials, a gallery of the artist's work, 
an about page, pricing tables, a clear step-by-step guide to ordering and a contact page. 
The primary goal of the website is to lead potential customers to making first contact with the
artist via the contact page. 
​
An important note on the longer path to buy is that unlike most B2C websites - which are emotion driven to impulse buy and have the fewest number of steps to the point of purchase -
ordering a custom portrait is an expensive and significant purchase, and one that comes with the need for more information than the average B2C purchase. 
This website tries to address the needs of the customer to find all the information that they need to make a decision to contact the artist, 
while breaking the information up into small easy to understand sections, and making the steps to the point of contact as clear and easy to follow as possible.

The business goals of this website are:
* Build brand awareness.
* Provide high quality examples of the artist's drawings and paintings.
* Drive sales in the form of first contact (via the contact page) that will then lead to a sales call with the artist. 
* Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to fill out the contact form.
​
The customer goals of this website are:
* Searching for high quality, bespoke artwork for their home or treasured gift. 
* Clear easy to find pricing.
* Intuitive ordering process.
 
## UX
​
#### Ideal client
​
##### The ideal client for this business is:
* English speaking.
* Has disposable income.
* Is a parent.
* Lives in the Netherlands (but can be anywhere in the world).
​
##### Visitors to this website are searching for:
* An artist to create a custom portrait featuring their child(ren) to decorate their home. 
* And/or a bespoke gift. 
​
##### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* Most artists' websites have very poor UX. 
* Other artists' websites are over complicated and produce information overload quickly. 
* This website is:
    * Easy to navigate.
    * Steps the client through easy to understand learnable information.
    * Gives the client the information they need without overloading them.
    * Guiding them to the goal of the website - to fill out the contact form.
